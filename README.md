# Template Quarto Revealjs site

This template can be used to publish a [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com/) website that has been written in
[Quarto](https://www.quarto.org). It includes a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) which will convert
the Quarto source to HTML and publish them via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Its a useful way of making slides portable as they are then available via the URL and naturally the slides are version
controlled.


# Usage

## Use the Template

Start by clicking on the "_Use this Template_" button and selecting "_Create a new repository_". You will have to choose
a name for the repository. When ready click on "_Create repository from template_" and this will copy all the resources
into a new repository under your GitHub account ready for you to start using. You will probably want to clone the
repository locally to do so.

## Edit `_quarto.yaml`

You will have to edit `_quarto.yaml` and change the `site-url` to reflect your GitHub user account and the name of the
repository you have chosen for this project. Its probably wise to modify the `title` and `description` too. The sample
code below shows in capitals the fields you should modify.

``` yaml
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "<INSERT_TITLE>"
  site-url: https://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<NAME_OF_REPOSITORY>
  description: "<INSERT_DESCRIPTION>"
```

## Publish Locally

You will need to run `quarto publish gh-pages` once locally before deploying this template.

## Repository settings

You will also need to make sure your repository action settings are configured to allow read and write permissions.

You can find this settings at `https://github.com/[USER]/[repo]/settings/actions`

## Write your slides

You are now ready to create your slides by editing the `index.qmd` in the root of the repository. For more information
on writing RevealJS slides in Quarto see the [RevealJS](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) guide and the
[Revealjs Reference](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/presentations/revealjs.html).

## pre-commit

A basic [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) configuration is included (see ~.pre-commit-config.yaml~) however to use it
you will have to install `pre-commit` in your cloned repository. This requires `pre-commit` to be installed on your
system or within a Python Virtual Environment. To find out more about installing and configuring `pre-commit` see the
article [pre-commit : Protecting your future self](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/pre-commit/).

# Extensions

There is a growing number of useful [Quarto extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/).

## QR Code generation

The [quarto-qrcode](https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-qrcode) extension  is particularly useful as it simplifies
generating and embedding [QR Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) that link to websites in your slides.
